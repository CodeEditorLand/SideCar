//! SideCar binary entry point
//!
//! This file serves as the main entry point for the SideCar application.
//! It calls the main function from the library.

fn main() {
    // DEPENDENCY: Move the main function from Library.rs here in a future refactor
    // Currently Library.rs contains both lib and binary code
    // For now, delegate to the library's main function
    use SideCar::main as lib_main;
    lib_main();
